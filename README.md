# Diabetes_Prediction_ML_Model-1

This project implements a **Diabetes Prediction** machine learning model using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. The model predicts whether a person is diabetic based on various medical factors such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and others.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and scales features using `StandardScaler`.
- **Model Training**: A Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel is used for classification.
- **Evaluation**: The model's accuracy is measured on test data to assess performance.
- **User Input**: The model takes input from the user to predict if the person is diabetic or not.

### Tools & Libraries:
- Python (NumPy, Pandas)
- Scikit-learn (SVM, StandardScaler)
- Jupyter Notebook

### How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the model.

This project demonstrates a basic machine learning workflow, from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
